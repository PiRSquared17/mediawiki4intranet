Installation instructions for HaloACL extension v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.13.2
    SMW 1.4.2 (optional)

Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install HaloACL is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i haloacl

This installs the extension and patches MediaWiki and SMW.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder HaloACL into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. HaloACL will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

However, you can apply two patches:
* patch_for_MW_1.13.2.txt: 
	This patch for MediaWiki 1.13.2 removes all links to protected pages from 
	the rendered articles and listings. If a link can not be removed, it is 
	replaced by a link to the page 'Permission denied'. This patch is optional.
* patch_for_SMW_1.4.2.txt: 
	This patch for SMW 1.4.2 is mandatory, if you want to protect the values of 
	semantic properties.


Updating the database
---------------------

The HaloACL extension requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the HaloACL extension and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php


Activating HaloACL
------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/HaloACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
enableHaloACL(); 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in HACL_Initialize.php.
