# generated for new pages.

# specify a master template (a name of an article) that is used to create a

# The given master templates are copied to the user's own right space defined
# by the naming convention "ACL:Right/<username>/<Right name>".

# (Please note the "ACL:Template" depends on the content language, i.e. in german
# it will be "Rechte:Vorlage/QARMT/<Right name>".)
# Example for user "Thomas":
# The template "ACL:Template/QARMT/Private use" will be copied to
# "ACL:Right/Thomas/Private use".
# The master templates is are normal security descriptors that can contain the
# variable "{{{user}}}" that will be replaced by the user's name.
